# CLAUDE.md — Vintage King Redesign Handoff

**Repo scope (`vk-secondary-pages`):** This repository builds **standalone secondary `.html` pages** and maintains **`navigator.html`** as a **local inventory only**. **Do not** link to, open, embed, import, or edit the core single-file prototype (`VintageKing-Redesign-*.html`) or any file under the separate **vintage-king-redesign** project. Tokens and rules below still apply to secondary pages. See **`HANDOFF.md`** and **`.cursor/rules/vk-secondary-pages.mdc`**.

## READ THIS FIRST
This file is the complete briefing for the Vintage King redesign (including the main prototype). Read it fully before touching design tokens. For **this repo’s** file list and page specs, prefer **`HANDOFF.md`**. Working file for the main prototype is **not** edited here.

## Design System (LOCKED)
- Display font: Playfair Display — headings, product names, large stats only
- - Body font: DM Sans — all body copy, labels, buttons, pricing
  - - PRICING RULE: DM Sans ONLY, font-weight:500, color:var(--near-black). Never Playfair on numbers.
    - - --vk-red: #C0392B — primary CTA, eyebrow accents on ecommerce pages
      - - --near-black: #1A1A18 — primary text
        - - --amber: #D4860A — ALL secondary pages accent (eyebrows, CTAs, accent lines). Also Vintage/Used content in core ecommerce.
          - - --warm-white: #FDFCFB — primary background
            - - --off-white: #F7F5F2 — section backgrounds
              - - --amber-bg: #F5E6C8 — credential bars, info boxes
                - - --secondary-accent: #D4860A — all secondary pages use amber. Red reserved for core ecommerce screens only (pages/ folder).
                - - --page-accent: #D4860A — per-page accent variable, always amber on secondary pages.
                  - - Blue #2563EB / #EEF4FF — informational elements only (Open Box badge, buyer guide)
                    - - **BANNED: #fde8e6** — too pinkish on uncalibrated screens. Use rgba(26,26,24,0.07) for neutral badge/pill backgrounds instead.
                    - - **BANNED: rgba(192,57,43,0.04–0.08) as a standalone background** — looks pinkish. Use var(--off-white) or rgba(26,26,24,0.04–0.08) for light tint backgrounds.
                    - - CB2.com is the foundational design reference: one message per zone, white space as a feature
                      - - Minimum font size: 12px everywhere. Nothing below 12px.

                                                    14. The navigation needs to match CB2/Apple standard — currently too small and tight.
                                                    15. - Logo wordmark "VINTAGE KING" — CSS class .logo-text .name — currently 14px. Too small. Increase.
                                                        - - Logo icon (SVG mark) — also too small. Scale up proportionally.
                                                          - - Nav overall font feels tight — review .nav-link, .topbar font sizes
                                                            - - "Pro Audio Outfitter" tagline (.logo-text .tagline) — LOCKED. Do not remove. Currently 12px.
                                                              - - Mega menu column headers already bumped to 12px in v2.65 — do not touch
                                                                - - Ask mode before touching nav CSS. Show dry-run diff before applying.

                                                                  - Contains: full typography scale (H1–body–micro), when to use red vs amber vs near-black vs grey, minimum sizes, font weights, pricing rules, eyebrow rules, badge rules.

This is the most technically complex remaining page. The taxonomy is deep — allocate a full session.
